# geolocating_tweets
SMM phase 2 project 


<h3>Pre Processing</h3>  
1) Loading data from json to csv  
   Run ‘loadfiles.py path’, Give input location to the folder where the original data is present.  
2) Removing all non-alphanumeric characters   
   Run ‘remove_chars.csv filename’  
3) Extract hashtags from raw data and merge with the output of above step for different dataset  
Run ‘hashtags.py raw_filename merge_filename’  

<h3>Classification</h3>  
1) ‘nb_classifier.py’ has the implementation of tf-ids, Inverse cluster frequencies and Naïve Bayes classifier.  
It has different modes:  
•	Run ‘python nb_classifier.py filepath 2 1000’  for Inverse Cluster Frequency Model, 
change 1000 to any number to increase number of tweets to process  
•	Run ‘python nb_classifier.py filepath 1 1000’  for unique words model, change 1000 to any number 
to increase number of tweets to process  
•	Search for below line and Change False to True to enable cross validation  
	def main(path, n =1000, cv=False)  
‘python nb_classifier.py filepath 1 1000’  to run cross validation.
